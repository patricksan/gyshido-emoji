“GyShiDo is a project by Pascal Finette, Daniel Epstein and Will Butler. The robot graphics were designed by the amazing team at DOJO4.”

All I did here was resize the robot graphics and export them in a Slack-friendly format. It took about five minutes. So… all credit to the productive people above.
